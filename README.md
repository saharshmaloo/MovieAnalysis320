Why this dataset?
Movies are an integral part of pop culture, and we as a group are interested in examining what factors make certain movies more successful than others. This can serve to be a great tool for insight into how to make exceptional movies that entertain larger audiences.
The chosen data set is extremely thorough and provides key metrics such as the user ratings, budget, cast, and also includes information about the specific movies like genre, plot, and keywords pertaining to that movie. This information gives us a variety of tools to explore what makes certain movies more popular than others.
